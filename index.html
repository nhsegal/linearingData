<h2>What is this?</h2>
This website presents you with a set of data where there is a nonlinear relationship 
between the dependent and independent variables. You can alter how the data is plotted 
to reveal this relationship. The point is to familarize you with a
particular data analysis technique: plotting a variable vs. a function of another variable 
in order to create a linear plot. 
<br><br>
The graph initially displays a set of data where the dependent variable is plotted against 
the independent variable. Two variables are related by some power law. (<i>i.e.</i> 
They fit the equation <i>y=Ax<sup>B</sup></i>.) The data also has a little bit of noise in it. 
Notice how the plot changes when you select different horizontal axes for the same dataset. 
One plot should be nearly linear, and you can determine the equation of the line of best fit. 
This equation also yields the power law that describes the relationship between the independent 
and dependent variables. One can confirm this after fitting the equation by transforming the horizontal
x-axis.

<h2>What's up with the units of the slope?</h2>
An equation that related different measurements only makes sense if the numerical quantities in it have units.
The coefficient in front the independent variable must also have units. This sim unfortunately 
does not always display the coefficient's combination of units in the most simplified form, but the upside of this
is that the user can see that how the units relate to the units of the quantities on each axis.

<h2>Why not fit the raw data with a curve instead of transforming the data to linearize it?</h2>
There are advantages to both methods. One advantage of linearizing is that it helps one spot outliers and 
systematic deviations from the model. Another advantage is that it requires less technology than nonlinear curve-fitting. 
However, the main reason I believe linearing data should continue to be taught is that it improves students' 
understanding of proportionality, variation, and the meaning of power laws. Interpreting the slope of these graphs
is a worthwhile exercise. 

<h2>Do the different datasets refer to specifc experiments?</h2>
The data is randomally generated, but the choice of variables relates to specific experiments. One involves measuring the 
side length and mass of a series of similiar triangles cut from a uniform sheet of material; one involves measuring the width and height
of a series of paragraphs which display the same content; and one involves measuring the intensity of light from a small bulb at
various distances.
