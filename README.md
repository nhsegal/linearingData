# Linearizing Data
I originally coded this many years ago but recently rewrote it twice - one to improve the experience for the user and then again to clean up the code. I can't believe how much work it was to refactor.

The two core ideas motivating this sim are 1.) linearizing data plots is a valuable tool for students to build their understanding and 2.) if they could see how the data points in the original plot map to the points on the linearized plot it would help them understand the process.

I haven't yet used this sim in the classroom. I have used a linearization activity which is listed aboved at 3.1 Linearization Activity.
